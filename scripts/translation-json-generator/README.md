### Notes
We use google sheet as a source of truth for the translation text in different locales. 

To update translation text, edit directly in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_yx09THl9qcBboJvvBwPTY63MfKIIB8WzEDstIOI6s/edit#gid=0).

Do not update `lang/{locale}.js` directly as these files are generated by the script and will be overwritten when the script runs.

Run `sh run.sh` to download google sheet and generate locales translation. 

For debugging, run `python lang-generator.py --list` to show the commands
